Since making the blog, I've realized that blogging isn't really the best medium for the kind of writing that I'm most interested in.
For one thing, the expectation of blogs is that once they're published, they aren't liable to change.
Sure, you might make a minor change here or there, and that's acceptable and marked with a note, but there's something untoward about drastic changes.
And therein lies the problem for me.
If I'm going to write something philosophical, I'd like there to be a canonical version.

My solution is to add a kind of living document format to this site.
Even better is that I can leverage some of the technology already going on behind the scenes.
This site is hosted on GitHub, so any changes I make have i] commit messages, and ii] file diffs (a list of changes between versions).
This means I can use this take make apparent how in-progress, or how neglected, or how stable a given document might be.
If the history pane is fairly quiet, maybe that means I like it.
If it's busy, you will know that I've been working on the topic lately.
